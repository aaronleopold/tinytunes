# Contributing to Tiny Tunes

I want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## I Develop with Github

I use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as I'll as accept pull requests.

## All External Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (reference for [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow#following-github-flow)). Before you make a PR, **make sure to let me know of your interest to contribute via issue**. To make a PR:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. Use a logical naming convention for your banch (`feature/<feature_name>`, `bug/<bug_name>`).
3. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
4. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/aaronleopold/tinytunes/issues)

I use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/aaronleopold/tinytunes/issues/new); it's that easy!

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
  - Include pictures/videos if applicable.
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

Ensure you set up your development environment to properly format the codebase. I use the official Rust extension to format the Rust files, and Prettier to format pretty much everything else :)

## License

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under its MIT License.
