## Bugs / Issues

Some of these are current limitations of Tauri, which are either current bugs of Tauri or features not yet available in Tauri. If you find a bug or would like to contribute, please open an issue to address it.

- [ ] Hide window on click away
- [ ] Hide app handle (I can get this functional, however it introduces a weird amount of bugs. [Potential fix](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/2825))
- [ ] Right click tray icon for menu (Creating a native menu overrides the event handling, causing the tray icon to not respond to left clicks)
